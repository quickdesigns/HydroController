# HydroController
Arduino sketches and windows platform application for controlling a hydroponic system.


Version Notes

v0.1

This is the basic layout in an Arduino sketch for the control functions necessary to the basic hydroponic system. The unit is designed to function in both an automatic mode--where cycles operate at predetermined intervals--and a maintenance mode where individual functions can be activated at the control panel.

Some data has been hardcoded for testing purposes and will be abstracted in future versions prior to v1.0 where all user variables will be able to be manipulated.
